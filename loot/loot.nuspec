# LOOT: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
Setting the right load order for your TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.

While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

While we welcome user feedback, please check the [FAQs](https://loot.github.io/docs/help/LOOT-FAQs.html) in case you have a question that has already been answered. If you wish to report an issue, please read the [How To Report Issues Helpfully](https://loot.github.io/docs/help/How-To-Report-Issues-Helpfully.html) page for instructions.

		<releaseNotes>
0.12.4 - 2018-02-22
===================

Fixed
-----

- Loading or saving a load order could be very slow because the plugins
  directory was scanned recursively, which is unnecessary. In the reported case,
  this fix caused saving a load order to go from 23 seconds to 43 milliseconds
  (via the LOOT API).
- Plugin parsing errors were being logged with trace severity, they are now
  logged as errors (via the LOOT API).
- Chromium console messages are now logged with severity levels that better
  match the severity with which they appear in the console (via the LOOT API).
- Saving a load order for Oblivion, Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas now updates
  plugin access times to the current time for correctness (via the LOOT API).

Changed
-------

- Added a specific message for sorting errors that mentions plugins.txt probably
  being read-only, as it&apos;s the most common cause of issues filed.
- Added missing mentions of Fallout 4 VR support.
- Performance improvement for load order operations (via the LOOT API).
- Updated the LOOT API to v0.12.4.
- Updated spdlog to v0.16.3.
- Updated nlohmann/json to v3.1.1.
- Updated CEF to v3.3282.1733.g9091548.

0.12.3 - 2018-02-10
===================

Fixed
-----

- LOOT wouldn&apos;t start when run by a user with a ``%LOCALAPPDATA`` path
  containing non-ASCII characters, which was a regression introduced in v0.12.0.
- The log buffer is flushed after every statement, fixing the regression
  introduced in v0.12.2.
- The uninstaller didn&apos;t remove ``settings.toml``.

Changed
-------

- Disabled CEF debug logging, as the ``CEFDebugLog.txt`` has generally been more
  misleading than helpful.

0.12.2 - 2018-02-05
===================

Added
-----

- Support for Fallout 4 VR.
- Support for configuring games&apos; local paths, i.e. the directory in which their
  ``plugins.txt`` is stored. Each game entry in LOOT&apos;s ``settings.toml`` now has
  a ``local_path`` variable that is blank by default, which leaves it up to
  libloadorder (via the LOOT API) to determine the path. There is no GUI option
  to configure the value.
- Chromium console messages are now logged to ``LOOTDebugLog.txt`` to help when
  debugging.

Changed
-------

- Updated LOOT API to v0.12.3.
- Replaced Protocol Buffers serialisation dependency with nlohmann/json v2.1.1.
- Replaced Boost.Log with spdlog v0.14.0.
- Downgraded Boost to 1.63.0 to take advantage of pre-built binaries on
  AppVeyor.
- Updated Japanese translation.

Removed
-------

- The ``--game-appdata-path`` CLI parameter, which set the local path to use for
  all games, and which has been superceded by game-specific ``local_path``
  configuration variables.

Fixed
-----

- Plugins with a ``.esp`` file extension and the light master flag set are no
  longer treated as masters when sorting, so they can have other ``.esp`` files
  as masters without causing cyclic interaction sorting errors (via LOOT API).
- Sorting didn&apos;t update sidebar indices.

0.12.1 - 2017-12-03
===================

Fixed
-----

- Settings would not save correctly with debug logging disabled.
- LOOT API logging was disabled on Linux.
- Typos in the v0.12.0 changelog.

0.12.0 - 2017-12-02
===================

Added
-----

- Support for light master (``.esl``) plugins.

  - Light masters are indicated by a new icon on their plugin cards, and the
    &quot;Master File&quot; icon is suppressed for light masters.
  - In the sidebar, light masters all have the in-game load order index ``FE``,
    followed by the hexadecimal index of the light master relative to only other
    light masters.
  - A new general warning message will be displayed when 255 normal plugins and
    at least one light master are active.
  - A new error message will be displayed for light masters that depend on a
    non-master plugin.

- Support for specifying the game local app data path using the
  ``--game-appdata-path=&lt;path&gt;`` command line parameter.
- Japanese translation by kuroko137.

Changed
-------

- LOOT now stores its settings in a ``settings.toml`` file instead of a
  ``settings.yaml`` file. It cannot upgrade from the latter to the former
  itself, but a converter is available `online`_.
- &quot;Copy Load Order&quot; now includes a third column for the index of light masters
  relative to other light masters.
- Updated the UI to use Polymer v2 and updated LOOT&apos;s custom elements to use the
  Custom Elements v1 syntax.
- LOOT API log messages are now included in the ``LOOTDebugLog.txt`` file, and
  are no longer written to ``LOOTAPIDebugLog.txt``.
- Updated the Chinese translation.
- Updated the Danish translation.
- Updated the Russian translation.
- Updated the LOOT API to v0.12.1.
- Updated Lodash to b4.17.4.
- Updated Octokat to v0.8.0.
- Updated CEF to v3.3163.1671.g700dc25.

Fixed
-----

- Error when adding a Bash Tag with no condition using the metadata editor.
- Detection of Skyrim and Skyrim SE when LOOT is installed in the same directory
  as both.
- General messages disappearing when cancelling a sort.
- Blank messages&apos; content in the metadata editor after updating the masterlist.
- LOOT window size/position not restoring maximised state correctly.
- &quot;Cannot read property of &apos;text&apos; of undefined&quot; error messages when something
  went wrong.
- The &quot;new version available&quot; message is no longer displayed for snapshot builds
  built from code newer than the latest release.
- Significant fixes in the LOOT API:

  - A crash would occur when loading an plugin that had invalid data past its
    header. Such plugins are now just silently ignored.
  - LOOT would not resolve game or local data paths that are junction links
    correctly, which caused problems later when trying to perform actions such
    as loading plugins.
  - Performing a masterlist update on a branch where the remote and local
    histories had diverged would fail. The existing local branch is now
    discarded and the remote branch checked out anew, as intended.		</releaseNotes>
