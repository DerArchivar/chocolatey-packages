# LOOT: The Load Order Optimisation Tool
Setting the right load order for your TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, TES V: Skyrim Special Edition, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 4 VR mods is a crucial step to enjoying a stable modded game. The Load Order Optimisation Tool (LOOT) can help with that, by providing automated load order sorting that's simple to use and fully customisable.

While sorting, LOOT checks for load order errors (such as incompatibilities and missing requirements) and notifies you of any issues that it detects. It also provides thousands of plugin-specific messages, such as usage notes and bug warnings, to help keep your game healthy.

While we welcome user feedback, please check the [FAQs](https://loot.github.io/docs/help/LOOT-FAQs.html) in case you have a question that has already been answered. If you wish to report an issue, please read the [How To Report Issues Helpfully](https://loot.github.io/docs/help/How-To-Report-Issues-Helpfully.html) page for instructions.

0.12.5 - 2018-03-19
===================

Fixed
-----

- LOOT now checks that its game subdirectories are actually directories, not just that they exist, erroring earlier and more helpfully when there is somehow a file with the same name in the LOOT data directory.
- Windows 7 users can now update their masterlists again without having to manually enable system-wide TLS 1.2 support. This was an issue after GitHub disabled support for older, insecure versions of TLS encryption because Microsoft didn’t enable TLS 1.2 support in Windows 7 by default. Fixed via the LOOT API.

Changed
-------

- Migrated all non-Polymer GUI dependencies from Bower to NPM.
- Refactored GUI JavaScript and custom elements into ES2015 modules.
- Introduced Webpack to bundle JavaScript and CSS for the GUI.
- Updated Polymer to v2.5.0.
- Updated the LOOT API to v0.12.5.
