# Nexus Mod Manager
The Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) is a free and open source piece of software that allows you to download, install, update and manage your mod files through an easy to use interface. It integrates with the Nexus sites to provide you with a fast, efficient and much less hassled modding experience.

### Legacy Package
This is the legacy version of NMM which is only being offered in order to support Windows XP. If you have a Windows later than that, please do **not** install this package and rather use the up-to-date 'nmm' package.

### Features

   * No faffing about with zip programs, no hassle.
   
 - **Built in download manager**

   * The mod manager comes with full download pause and resume functionality.
   * Stop your downloads and start them again later from the same place.

 - **Mod manager**
 
   Enable or disable the files you would like loaded into your game through the easy to use mod management system, allowing you to try different configurations and profiles quickly and easily.

 - **Clean mod installs**
 
   Files are installed cleanly and if a mod can't finish installing for any reason the mod manager will clean up the files correctly after itself
   
 - **Open source**
 
   Completely free and completely open source, released under a copyleft GPL license, you can be sure that the mod manager is safe to use and free of adware, spyware and viruses
